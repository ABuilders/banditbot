####### IMPORTANT NOTICE #######  
# Granting developer access does NOT override permissions for moderation, utility,  
# or any other commands in external servers.  
#  
# Misuse of this access to bypass server rules is strictly against our bot's policies.  
# We appreciate your understanding.  
#  
# Developer access is intended solely for testing commands in the development server.  
# Most testing commands do not alter any settings in user servers; they are used  
# purely to verify the bot's functionality.
